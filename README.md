# LowLevel coding in Tensorflow
In this repo, the idea is to recreate models, layers, operations in Tensorflow
wihtout using High Level API such as Keras. Thus, relying on linear algebra and 
low level utilities of Tensorflow.
The concept comes in handy when creating custom models, custom layers etc.
To understand the inner workings of Neural Nets instead of using high level APIs.
